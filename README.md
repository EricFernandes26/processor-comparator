# processor-comparator
processor comparator made with python


This project aims to conduct a performance comparison of processors, whether AMD or Intel. The code was written in Python using Boto3 to integrate with the Bedrock service.


# execution
When executing the code, it prompts us to input the names of the processors we would like to compare.

After entering the names of the desired processors, a graph is generated using the Python matplotlib library.
